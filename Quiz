4. What are the start and end dates of the experiment?
Jan 25,2023-Feb6,2023
5. How many total users were in the experiment?
48943
6. How many users were in the control and treatment groups?
Treatment: B group: 24600, Control: A group: 24343
7. What was the conversion rate of all users?
4.28%
8. What is the user conversion rate for the control and treatment groups?
control: A: 3.92% , Treatment:B:4.63%
9. What is the average amount spent per user for the control and treatment groups, including users who did not convert?
Control: $3.366, Treatment: $3.380
10.Why is it helpful to include users who did not convert when calculating the average amount spent per user?
In order to measure the impact on total revenue (amount spent), 
we cannot only average the users who converted because there could have been fewer users who converted in the treatment.
