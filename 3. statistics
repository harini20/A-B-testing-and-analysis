1. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Target Population : Whether there is a statistical difference introducing the banner or not 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference with banner
Alternate Hypothesis: There is difference with banner 
Independent Variable: Banner
Dependent variable: Revenue

Determine the type of test:
which is conversion rate? 
CONVERTED COLUMN HAVING 0 AND 1
the mean of a binary variable- A binary variable is a variable that can take on only two values, such as 0 or 1, success or failure, yes or no. 
The mean of a binary variable is the proportion of successes. In the example above, the mean of the binary variable conversion would be 0.2, which is equal to the conversion rate of 20%.
is asking about the mean of a binary variable, which is a proportion.

- Conversion rate is a proportion 
- Evaluating/ comparing 2 samples(A/B test)
- TWO-TAILED TEST 
we are interested in whether the conversion rate in the control group is different from the conversion rate in the treatment group. 

Formula:
Hypothesis Test for a Difference in Proportions
Two-sample z-test with pooled proportion
Use the unpooled proportions above if p0 is something other than 0.
Hypotheses 	H0:p1−p2=p0
            H1:p1−p2<>p0
Test Statistic  T=(p^1−p^2)−p0/sqrt((p^(1−p^)(1/n1+1/n2))
                p^=p^1∗n1+p^2∗n2/n1+n2
p- value 	2∗P(Z>∣T∣)

Calculate Test statistic:
p^1 = 1139/24600 = 0.046
p^2 = 955/24343 = 0.039
n1 = 24600
n2 = 24343
p^=p^1∗n1+p^2∗n2/n1+n2
~ 0.043

p0 = 0
T=(p^1−p^2)−p0/sqrt((p^(1−p^)(1/n1+1/n2))
7.634

Calculate the p- value:
2∗P(Z>∣T∣)
P(Z > |T|) = 1 - P(Z ≤ |T|)

P(Z > 7.634) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 7.634)
2 * P(Z > |T|) ≈ 2 * 0 = 0.
In hypothesis testing, the p-value is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

p-value < 0.05
0 < 0.05

Since the p-value is less than the significance level (0 < 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
Therefore, we can conclude that there is strong statistical evidence to suggest that the true difference in proportions between the treatment and control groups 
is not equal to the assumed value (p0). The proportions of the treatment and control groups are significantly different.
In summary, the analysis supports the alternative hypothesis (H1:p1−p2<>p0), indicating that there is a significant difference in proportions 
between the treatment and control groups. The treatment appears to have a meaningful impact on the proportion of users compared to the assumed value.


2. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the conversion rate between the treatment and control (treatment-control)?

Determine what type of interval you are computing
We can decide which interval to use based on 2 factors that you should have determined in the previous question:
1. Are we working with proportions or means?
- Proportions 
2. Are we evaluating one sample or comparing two samples?
- 2 samples 

Fomula:
Confidence Interval for a Difference in Proportions
Two-sample z-interval with unpooled proportions
sample statistic    p^1−p^2
critical value      z1−α/2
standard error      sqrt(p^1(1−p^1)/n1+p^2(1−p^2)/n2)

Calculate the sample statistic 
#The descriptive statistics to calculate sample statistics:
FOR TOTAL_SPENT Mean: 3.38273563 (Average)
For total spent Variance: 659.2028411
For total spent Standard deviation: 25.67494579

The conversion rate for each group can be used to compare the performance of the two groups.
Group A: 0.04   Control Group
Group B: 0.05   Treatment Group 
In this case, the treatment group has a higher conversion rate than the control group. 
This means that the treatment group is more likely to convert than the control group.
sample statistic: p^1 − p^2
p1 = conversion rate for treatment group 
p2 = conversion rate for control group 
the difference in the conversion rates =  0.05 - 0.04 = 0.01

Calculate the Standard error:
The standard error is a measure of how much variation there is in the difference in the conversion rates.

Formula:
standard error = sqrt((p1*(1-p1)/n1) + (p2*(1-p2)/n2))
sqrt((0.05*(1-0.05)/24600)+(0.04*(1-0.04)/24343))
the standard error of the difference in the proportions = 0.00592

calculate the Critical value 
95% confidence for an assumed normal distribution 
100-95 = 5%
The bell curve is 2.5% and 2.5%
100-2.5 = 97.5
The z score is found for the value close to 97.5 -> 0.975
z-score for the 95% confidence level = 1.96

critical value = 1.96. 
This means that the probability that a value drawn from the standard normal distribution <= 1.96 =  0.975. 

Construct the interval
margin of error = critical value * standard error
1.96 * 0.00592
0.00676

Confidence Interval = (Lower bound, Upper bound)
Lower bound = 0.01 - 0.00676 = 0.0032
Upper bound = 0.01 + 0.00676 = 0.0168
Confidence Interval = (0.0032, 0.0168) 

Since the confidence interval does not include zero, we can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between the 
proportions of the treatment and control groups. The treatment group has a higher proportion than the control group, 
with an estimated difference ranging from 0.0032 to 0.0168.
In summary, we can conclude that the treatment appears to have a significant effect on the proportion of users, 
with a higher proportion of users in the treatment group compared to the control group.


3. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the average amount spent per user between 
the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?Use the t distribution and a 5% significance level. 
Assume unequal variance.
Determine the null and alternative hypothesis:
to test the hypothesis that the average amount spent is different between the two groups.
null hypothesis -  average amount spent is the same for both groups. 
alternative hypothesis - average amount spent is different for the two groups.

Determine what type of test you are using:
conversion rate is proportion 
test statistic (T):
T = ((x̄1 - x̄2) - μ0) / sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2))
T ≈ 0.016 / 0.366 = 0.0437

df = min(n1 - 1, n2 - 1) = min(24599, 24342) = 24342
d = x1 - x2 = 3.391 - 3.375 = 0.016
SE = sqrt((s1^2 / n1) + (s2^2 / n2)) = sqrt((25.414^2 / 24600) + (25.936^2 / 24343)) = 0.038
t = d / SE = 0.016 / 0.038 = 0.421

p-value = 2 * P(T > |T|)
p-value ≈ 0.964
Since the p-value is greater than the significance level, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

Based on the provided calculations and assuming a significance level of 0.05, we can interpret the conclusion as follows:
The calculated t-value is 0.421, and the corresponding p-value is approximately 0.964. 
Since the p-value is greater than the significance level (0.964 > 0.05), we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
Therefore, we conclude that there is no statistically significant difference between the average amount spent per user in the treatment and control groups. 
The observed difference of 0.016 (or 0.0437 when considering the standardized t-value) is likely due to random variation or sampling variability. 
Any apparent difference between the two groups is not likely to be meaningful or significant in a broader population context.
In summary, based on the p-value being greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, 
suggesting that there is no significant difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment and control groups.


4. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment
and the control (treatment-control)?Use the t distribution and assume unequal variance.
x̄₁ = 3.391 (sample mean of treatment group)
x̄₂ = 3.375 (sample mean of control group)
s₁ = 25.414 (sample standard deviation of treatment group)
s₂ = 25.936 (sample standard deviation of control group)
n₁ = 24600 (sample size of treatment group)
n₂ = 24343 (sample size of control group)

degrees of freedom (df) using the formula:
df = min(n₁ - 1, n₂ - 1)
df = min(24600 - 1, 24343 - 1)
df = min(24599, 24342)
df = 24342

standard error (SE) using the formula:
SE = sqrt((s₁² / n₁) + (s₂² / n₂))
SE = sqrt((25.414² / 24600) + (25.936² / 24343))
SE ≈ sqrt((645.970996 / 24600) + (671.746496 / 24343))
SE ≈ sqrt(0.0262748 + 0.0275933)
SE ≈ sqrt(0.0538681)
SE ≈ 0.232173
95% confidence level using the t-distribution with df degrees of freedom. 
Since the distribution is two-tailed, we want the critical value that leaves 2.5% in each tail, so α = 0.05 / 2 = 0.025.

CV = t(1 - α/2, df)
= t(1 - 0.025, 24342)
CV ≈ 1.96

confidence interval (CI) using the formula:
CI = (x̄₁ - x̄₂) ± (CV * SE)
CI = (3.391 - 3.375) ± (1.96 * 0.232173)
CI = 0.016 ± 0.454079
CI ≈ (-0.438, 0.470)

Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment and control groups is 
approximately (-0.438, 0.470) we can conclude the following:
The range of values (-0.438 to 0.470) represents the likely range for the true difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment and 
control groups.
Since the interval contains both positive and negative values, we cannot conclude with certainty whether there is a statistically significant difference 
between the treatment and control groups in terms of the average amount spent per user.
The interval includes the value zero, which suggests that there is a possibility that the average amount spent per user in the treatment group is 
equal to the average amount spent per user in the control group.
Further analysis or additional data might be needed to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.
In summary, based on the provided confidence interval, we cannot definitively conclude whether there is a significant difference in the 
average amount spent per user between the treatment and control groups.
