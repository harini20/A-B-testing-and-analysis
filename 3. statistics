1. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Target Population : Whether there is a statistical difference introducing the banner or not 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference with banner
Alternate Hypothesis: There is difference with banner 
Independent Variable: Banner?
Dependent variable: Revenue?

Determine the type of test:
which is conversion rate? 
CONVERTED COLUMN HAVING 0 AND 1
the mean of a binary variable- A binary variable is a variable that can take on only two values, such as 0 or 1, success or failure, yes or no. 
The mean of a binary variable is the proportion of successes. In the example above, the mean of the binary variable conversion would be 0.2, which is equal to the conversion rate of 20%.
is asking about the mean of a binary variable, which is a proportion.

- Conversion rate is a proportion 
- Evaluating/ comparing 2 samples(A/B test)
- TWO-TAILED TEST 
we are interested in whether the conversion rate in the control group is different from the conversion rate in the treatment group. 

Calculate Test statistic:

2. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the conversion rate between the treatment and control (treatment-control)?

Determine what type of interval you are computing
We can decide which interval to use based on 2 factors that you should have determined in the previous question:
1. Are we working with proportions or means?
- Proportions 
2. Are we evaluating one sample or comparing two samples?
- 2 samples 

Calculate the sample statistic 
#The descriptive statistics to calculate sample statistics:
FOR TOTAL_SPENT Mean: 3.38273563 (Average)
Median: 
Mode: 
For total spent Variance: 659.2028411
For total spent Standard deviation: 25.67494579

The conversion rate for each group can be used to compare the performance of the two groups.
Group A: 3.923099043   Control Group
Group B: 4.630081301   Treatment Group 
In this case, the treatment group has a higher conversion rate than the control group. 
This means that the treatment group is more likely to convert than the control group.

Calculate the Standard error
the difference in the conversion rates =  0.71
The standard error is a measure of how much variation there is in the difference in the conversion rates.

Formula:
standard error = sqrt((p1*(1-p1)/n1) + (p2*(1-p2)/n2))
sqrt((0.05*(1-0.05)/24600)+(0.04*(1-0.04)/24343))
sqrt((0.05*0.95/24600)+(0.04*0.96/24343))
sqrt(3.51) = 1.87
