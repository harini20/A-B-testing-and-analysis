1. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Target Population : Whether there is a statistical difference introducing the banner or not 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference with banner
Alternate Hypothesis: There is difference with banner 
Independent Variable: Banner
Dependent variable: Revenue

Determine the type of test:
which is conversion rate? 
CONVERTED COLUMN HAVING 0 AND 1
the mean of a binary variable- A binary variable is a variable that can take on only two values, such as 0 or 1, success or failure, yes or no. 
The mean of a binary variable is the proportion of successes. In the example above, the mean of the binary variable conversion would be 0.2, which is equal to the conversion rate of 20%.
is asking about the mean of a binary variable, which is a proportion.

- Conversion rate is a proportion 
- Evaluating/ comparing 2 samples(A/B test)
- TWO-TAILED TEST 
we are interested in whether the conversion rate in the control group is different from the conversion rate in the treatment group. 

Formula:

Two-sample z-test with pooled proportion
Use the unpooled proportions above if p0 is something other than 0.
hypotheses
test statistic
p-value
Hypotheses 	H0:p1−p2=p0
            H1:p1−p2<>p0
Test Statistic  T=(p^1−p^2)−p0/sqrt((p^(1−p^)(1/n1+1/n2))
                p^=p^1∗n1+p^2∗n2/n1+n2
p- value 	2∗P(Z>∣T∣)

Calculate Test statistic:
p^1 = 1139/24600 = 0.046
p^2 = 955/24343 = 0.039
n1 = 24600
n2 = 24343
p^=p^1∗n1+p^2∗n2/n1+n2
~ 0.043

p0 = 0
T=(p^1−p^2)−p0/sqrt((p^(1−p^)(1/n1+1/n2))
7.634

Calculate the p- value:
2∗P(Z>∣T∣)
P(Z > |T|) = 1 - P(Z ≤ |T|)

P(Z > 7.634) = 1 - P(Z ≤ 7.634)
2 * P(Z > |T|) ≈ 2 * 0 = 0.
In hypothesis testing, the p-value is a measure of the evidence against the null hypothesis.

p-value < 0.05
0 < 0.05
we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. 


2. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the conversion rate between the treatment and control (treatment-control)?

Determine what type of interval you are computing
We can decide which interval to use based on 2 factors that you should have determined in the previous question:
1. Are we working with proportions or means?
- Proportions 
2. Are we evaluating one sample or comparing two samples?
- 2 samples 

Fomula:
Confidence Interval for a Difference in Proportions
Two-sample z-interval with unpooled proportions
sample statistic    p^1−p^2
critical value      z1−α/2
standard error      sqrt(p^1(1−p^1)/n1+p^2(1−p^2)/n2)

Calculate the sample statistic 
#The descriptive statistics to calculate sample statistics:
FOR TOTAL_SPENT Mean: 3.38273563 (Average)
For total spent Variance: 659.2028411
For total spent Standard deviation: 25.67494579

The conversion rate for each group can be used to compare the performance of the two groups.
Group A: 0.04   Control Group
Group B: 0.05   Treatment Group 
In this case, the treatment group has a higher conversion rate than the control group. 
This means that the treatment group is more likely to convert than the control group.
sample statistic: p^1 − p^2
p1 = conversion rate for treatment group 
p2 = conversion rate for control group 
the difference in the conversion rates =  0.05 - 0.04 = 0.01

Calculate the Standard error:
The standard error is a measure of how much variation there is in the difference in the conversion rates.

Formula:
standard error = sqrt((p1*(1-p1)/n1) + (p2*(1-p2)/n2))
sqrt((0.05*(1-0.05)/24600)+(0.04*(1-0.04)/24343))
the standard error of the difference in the proportions = 0.00592

calculate the Critical value 
95% confidence for an assumed normal distribution 
100-95 = 5%
The bell curve is 2.5% and 2.5%
100-2.5 = 97.5
The z score is found for the value close to 97.5 -> 0.975
z-score for the 95% confidence level = 1.96

critical value = 1.96. 
This means that the probability that a value drawn from the standard normal distribution <= 1.96 =  0.975. 

Construct the interval
margin of error = critical value * standard error
1.96 * 0.00592
0.00676

Confidence Interval = (Lower bound, Upper bound)
Lower bound = 0.01 - 0.00676 = 0.0032
Upper bound = 0.01 + 0.00676 = 0.0168
Confidence Interval = (0.0032, 0.0168) 

3. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the average amount spent per user between 
the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?Use the t distribution and a 5% significance level. 
Assume unequal variance.
Determine the null and alternative hypothesis:
to test the hypothesis that the average amount spent is different between the two groups.
null hypothesis -  average amount spent is the same for both groups. 
alternative hypothesis - average amount spent is different for the two groups.

Determine what type of test you are using:
conversion rate is proportion 

4. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment
and the control (treatment-control)?Use the t distribution and assume unequal variance.
