1. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Target Population : Whether there is a statistical difference introducing the banner or not 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference with banner
Alternate Hypothesis: There is difference with banner 
Independent Variable: Banner?
Dependent variable: Revenue?

Determine the type of test:
which is conversion rate? 
CONVERTED COLUMN HAVING 0 AND 1
the mean of a binary variable- A binary variable is a variable that can take on only two values, such as 0 or 1, success or failure, yes or no. 
The mean of a binary variable is the proportion of successes. In the example above, the mean of the binary variable conversion would be 0.2, which is equal to the conversion rate of 20%.
is asking about the mean of a binary variable, which is a proportion.

- Conversion rate is a proportion 
- Evaluating/ comparing 2 samples(A/B test)
- TWO-TAILED TEST 
we are interested in whether the conversion rate in the control group is different from the conversion rate in the treatment group. 

Calculate Test statistic:

2. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the conversion rate between the treatment and control (treatment-control)?

Determine what type of interval you are computing
We can decide which interval to use based on 2 factors that you should have determined in the previous question:
1. Are we working with proportions or means?
- Proportions 
2. Are we evaluating one sample or comparing two samples?
- 2 samples 

Calculate the sample statistic 
#The descriptive statistics to calculate sample statistics:

Median: 
Mode: 
Variance: 
Standard deviation:
