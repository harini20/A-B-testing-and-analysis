1. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Target Population : Whether there is a statistical difference introducing the banner or not 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference with banner
Alternate Hypothesis: There is difference with banner 
Independent Variable: Banner?
Dependent variable: Revenue?

Determine the type of test:
which is conversion rate? 
CONVERTED COLUMN HAVING 0 AND 1
the mean of a binary variable- A binary variable is a variable that can take on only two values, such as 0 or 1, success or failure, yes or no. 
The mean of a binary variable is the proportion of successes. In the example above, the mean of the binary variable conversion would be 0.2, which is equal to the conversion rate of 20%.
is asking about the mean of a binary variable, which is a proportion.

- Conversion rate is a proportion 
- Evaluating/ comparing 2 samples(A/B test)
- TWO-TAILED TEST 
we are interested in whether the conversion rate in the control group is different from the conversion rate in the treatment group. 

Calculate Test statistic:

2. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the conversion rate between the treatment and control (treatment-control)?

Determine what type of interval you are computing
We can decide which interval to use based on 2 factors that you should have determined in the previous question:
1. Are we working with proportions or means?
- Proportions 
2. Are we evaluating one sample or comparing two samples?
- 2 samples 

Calculate the sample statistic 
#The descriptive statistics to calculate sample statistics:
FOR TOTAL_SPENT Mean: 3.38273563 (Average)
Median: 
Mode: 
For total spent Variance: 659.2028411
For total spent Standard deviation: 25.67494579

The conversion rate for each group can be used to compare the performance of the two groups.
Group A: 0.04   Control Group
Group B: 0.05   Treatment Group 
In this case, the treatment group has a higher conversion rate than the control group. 
This means that the treatment group is more likely to convert than the control group.
sample statistic: p1 - p2
p1 = conversion rate for treatment group 
p2 = conversion rate for control group 
the difference in the conversion rates =  0.05 - 0.04 = 0.01

Calculate the Standard error
The standard error is a measure of how much variation there is in the difference in the conversion rates.

Formula:
standard error = sqrt((p1*(1-p1)/n1) + (p2*(1-p2)/n2))
sqrt((0.05*(1-0.05)/24600)+(0.04*(1-0.04)/24343))
the standard error of the difference in the proportions = 0.002

calculate the Critical value 
95% confidence for an assumed normal distribution 
100-95 = 5%
The bell curve is 2.5% and 2.5%
100-2.5 = 97.5
The z score is found for the value close to 97.5 -> 0.975
z-score for the 95% confidence level = 1.96

critical value = 1.96. 
This means that the probability that a value drawn from the standard normal distribution <= 1.96 =  0.975. 
This is the probability that is used in the NORM.INV function.

Construct the interval
margin of error = critical value * standard error
1.96 * 0.002
0.004

Confidence Interval = (Lower bound, Upper bound)
Lower bound = 0.01 - 0.004 = 0.006
Upper bound = 0.01 + 0.004 = 0.014
Confidence Interval = (0.006, 0.014) 

3. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the average amount spent per user between 
the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?Use the t distribution and a 5% significance level. 
Assume unequal variance.
Determine the null and alternative hypothesis:
to test the hypothesis that the average amount spent is different between the two groups.
null hypothesis -  average amount spent is the same for both groups. 
alternative hypothesis - average amount spent is different for the two groups.

Determine what type of test you are using:
conversion rate is proportion 

4. What is the 95% confidence interval for the difference in the average amount spent per user between the treatment
and the control (treatment-control)?Use the t distribution and assume unequal variance.
