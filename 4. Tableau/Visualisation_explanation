1. Create a visualisation to compare the conversion rate and average amount spent between the test groups.
Conversion rate: The conversion rate for group B is higher than group A. This indicates that group B has higher proportion of users who converted compared to group A.
Average amount: The average amount spent by group B is slightly higher than the average amount spent by users in group A. But the difference is small.
Conclusion:
Group B has a slightly higher conversion rate and a slightly higher average amount spent compared to group A.

5. Create visualizations to explore the relationship between the test metrics(conversion rate and average amount spent) and the user's country.
Based on the grouped bar chart visualisation:
Grouped bar chart is used to display multiple metrics side by side for each category enabling a direct comparison between the metrics within each country.
Conversion rate:
1. Canada has highest conversion rate followed by USA and Brazil.
2. Australia and Europe have relatively lower conversion rates.
Average amount spent:
1. USA has the highest average amount spent followed by Canada and Brazil.
2. Australia and Europe has lower average amounts spent compared to other regions.
It highlights regional variations and allows for comparison across different countries within each region.
