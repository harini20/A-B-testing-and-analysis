1. Create a visualisation to compare the conversion rate and average amount spent between the test groups.
Conversion rate: The conversion rate for group B is higher than group A. This indicates that group B has higher proportion of users who converted compared to group A.
Average amount: The average amount spent by group B is slightly higher than the average amount spent by users in group A. But the difference is small.
Conclusion:
Group B has a slightly higher conversion rate and a slightly higher average amount spent compared to group A.
