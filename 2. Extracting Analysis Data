1. Write a SQL query that returns: the user ID, the user’s country, the user’s gender, the user’s device type, the user’s test group, 
whether or not they converted (spent > $0), and how much they spent in total ($0+). 
# left joined all the 3 tables
select 
    coalesce(u.id, g.uid, a.uid) as id,
    u.country,
    coalesce(u.gender,'unknown') as gender,
    g.device,
    g.group as category, 
    case 
        when sum(a.spent)>0 then 1
        else 0
    end as converted,
    coalesce(sum(a.spent),0) as total_spent
from users u 
left join groups g on u.id=g.uid
left join activity a on coalesce(u.id, g.uid) = a.uid
group by coalesce(u.id, g.uid, a.uid),u.country,gender,g.device,category
order by id ASC;
