select uid, count(uid) as counts
from activity
group by uid;

#users appearing more than once

from activity
group by uid

- Left join 
#left joining users table with activity table 
select COALESCE(users.id, activity.uid) AS id, country,gender,dt,device,spent
from users
left join activity 
on users.id = activity.uid;

#to find the total count of users - 49082
with cte as(
    select COALESCE(users.id, activity.uid) AS id, country,gender,dt,device,spent
from users
left join activity 
on users.id = activity.uid)
