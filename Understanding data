1. Can a user show up more than once in the activity table? Yes or no, and why?
#users showing up count - 2094 total 
select uid, count(uid) as counts
from activity
group by uid;

#users appearing more than once 
select uid, count(uid) as counts
from activity
group by uid
having count(uid) > 1;

#Total users more than once in activity table - 139 users 
with cte as(select uid, count(uid) as counts
from activity
group by uid
having count(uid) > 1)
select count(*) as total 
from cte;

2. What type of join should we use to join the users table to the activity table?
