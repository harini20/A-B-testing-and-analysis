1. Conduct a hypothesis test to see whether there is a difference in the conversion rate between the two groups. What are the resulting p-value and conclusion?
Target Population : Whether there is a statistical difference introducing the banner or not 
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference with banner
Alternate Hypothesis: There is difference with banner 
Independent Variable: Banner?
Dependent variable: Revenue?

Determine the test:
which is conversion rate? total? or 1 and 0?
If 1 and 0 then:
- Conversion rate is a proportion 
- Evaluating/ comparing 2 samples(A/B test)
