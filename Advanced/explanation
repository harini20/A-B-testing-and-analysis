Baseline Conversion Rate = (C_converted / C_total) * 100
A: control group converted = C_converted
C_converted = 956
C_total = 24343
956/24343 = 3.93%
Baseline Conversion Rate = 3.93%

Relative Change = 10%
Absolute Improvement = Baseline Conversion Rate * Relative Change
= 3.93% * 0.10
= 0.393%
desired lift = 0.393% (0.00393 as a decimal)
To observe at least a 10% difference in the conversion rate between the treatment group and the control group to consider it statistically significant.

MDE = (Desired Lift / Baseline Conversion Rate) * 100
MDE = (0.00393 / 0.0393) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%
Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) = 10%.
To observe at least a 10% difference in the conversion rate between the treatment group and the control group to consider it statistically significant.

A/B Split Ratio = Number of users in Group B / (Number of users in Group A + Number of users in Group B)
A/B Split Ratio = 24,600 / (24,343 + 24,600) = 0.5015 (or 50.15%) = 0.5
