Explore the sample size calculators below to figure out how many users we should have aimed to have in our test before making a conclusion.
Identifying the specific statistical test or analysis plan to conduct A/B test. For example, comparing two proportions
Baseline Conversion Rate = (C_converted / C_total) * 100
A: control group converted = C_converted
C_converted = 956
C_total = 24343
956/24343 = 3.93%
Baseline Conversion Rate = 3.93%

Relative Change = 10%
Absolute Improvement = Baseline Conversion Rate * Relative Change
= 3.93% * 0.10
= 0.393%
desired lift = 0.393% (0.00393 as a decimal)
To observe at least a 10% difference in the conversion rate between the treatment group and the control group to consider it statistically significant.

MDE = (Desired Lift / Baseline Conversion Rate) * 100
MDE = (0.00393 / 0.0393) * 100
= 0.10 * 100
= 10%
Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) = 10%.
To observe at least a 10% difference in the conversion rate between the treatment group and the control group to consider it statistically significant.
Calculated the sample sizes for the experiment: 40300
The actual size of the experiment: 48943
The fact that your actual sample size is larger than the calculated sample size suggests that you have collected more data than initially estimated. 
In conclusion, having a sample size larger than the calculated size indicates that you have collected more data than initially planned, which can potentially lead to more reliable and powerful results.
